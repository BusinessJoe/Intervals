# Intervals
A Django/React webapp that trains the user to identify musical intervals in a progressive, quiz based system. 
Users can create accounts to save their progress.

Automated tests can be found in the tests folder. Uses a postgres database.
A secret .env file (not shown on github) is used to conceal sensitive information such as the Django secret key and database information.
